## What is Miruken

Miruken is an application framework that embraces composition, convention, decoration, intention, and aspect-oriented programming.

**Inversion of Control** is the principle that separates a framework from an API.  Miruken leverages the dynamic and object oriented capabilities of programming languages.  Miruken focuses on the challenges surrounding **models** and **controllers**. It does all the heavy lifting of mapping, validation, and error handling. Other frameworks have the **view** covered.  

## What does Miruken mean?

Miru and ken are Japanese words that both mean "view". Put them together and you have **Miruken**.  It means "a view of a view" and alludes to composition.
